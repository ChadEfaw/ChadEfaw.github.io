      <h2>Universal Competencies</h2>
      <div>
            <h3>Competency 1: To lead and manage in the public interest</h3>
            <p>Currently, I am part of <a href = "https://wvhub.org/2024/04/introducing-northside-east-end-of-bluefield-fairmont-two-cultivate-wv-communities/">Cultivate Fairmont</a>, a program affiliated with the Community Development Hub of West Virginia. This program will spend the next 12 months facilitating feedback from the public; identifying community needs; and allocating $50,000 to various projects around the city.</p>
      </div>
            
      <div>
            <h3>Competency 2: To participate in, and contribute to, the policy process</h3>
        <p>Before coming to West Virginia University, I worked as a data analyst for the City of Pittsburgh. While this role was technical in nature, I was able to identify racial biases in arrests versus citation rates between police zones in the City. </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
            <h3>Competency 3: To analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems, and make evidence-informed decisions in a complex and dynamic environment</h3>
            
            <p>I have intentionally tailored my assignments towards environmental conservation using statistics and GIS-informed decision-making. For example, I identified a <a href = "https://github.com/ChadEfaw/ChadEfaw.github.io/blob/main/Efaw_EnvironmentalControlSystems.pdf">natural experimen</a>t in that two coal-fired power plants in West Virginia – owned by the same company – had distinct environmental control systems. Are there statistically significant epidemiological differences in health outcomes of employees at each site? To answer that question, I designed a survey instrument, data collection and analysis plan. Second, I completed a <a href = "https://github.com/ChadEfaw/ChadEfaw.github.io/blob/main/Efaw_Geog550_Final.pdf">spatial-temporal analysis of fossil fuel production in West Virginia from 1970 to 2020.</a> This analysis allowed me to track the moving “center of gravity” of extraction and production – as well as the evolving modal production type: coal and then natural natural gas – over time throughout the state. Are current regulations equipped to protect human health and wellbeing when the mode of resource extraction changes – in space, time, and type?
</p>

      <div>
            <h3>Competency 4: To articulate, apply, and advance a public service perspective</h3>
            
            <p>My public service perspective has been developing through each semester and professional experience. When I took PUBA 710 - Administrative Ethics, I was strictly consequentialist, teleological, in my thinking; what is the end result of any given policy? Through that course, however, I learned that there are many competing and complementary ethical  frameworks.</p>
            
      </div>
      
      <div>
            <h3>Competency 5: To communicate and interact productively and in culturally responsive ways with a diverse and changing workforce and society at large</h3>
            
            <p>The most important professional experience of my life was being (unofficially) part of the <a href = "https://www.cyber.pitt.edu/algorithms#:~:text=The%20Pittsburgh%20Task%20Force%20on,and%20equity%20for%20all%20residents.">Pittsburgh Task Force on Public Algorithms </a>. This task force identified instances of where machine learning algorithms were used to make decisions in the public sector. Were these algorithms fair? Did they have biases? Who created them? I performed literature reviews and participated in public hearings.</p>
