            <h3>Cultivate Fairmont</h3>
            <p>I am part of <a href = "https://wvhub.org/2024/04/introducing-northside-east-end-of-bluefield-fairmont-two-cultivate-wv-communities/">Cultivate Fairmont</a>, a program affiliated with the Community Development Hub of West Virginia. This program will spend the next 12 months facilitating feedback from the public; identifying community needs; and allocating $50,000 to various projects around the city.</p>

            <h3>GIS and Spatial Analysis</h3>
            
            <p>I have intentionally tailored my assignments towards environmental conservation using statistics and GIS-informed decision-making. 
            For example, I identified a <a href = "https://github.com/ChadEfaw/ChadEfaw.github.io/blob/main/Efaw_EnvironmentalControlSystems.pdf">natural experiment</a> in that two coal-fired power plants in West Virginia – owned by the same company – had distinct environmental control systems. Are there statistically significant epidemiological differences in health outcomes of employees at each site? To answer that question, I designed a survey instrument, data collection and analysis plan. Second, I completed a <a href = "https://github.com/ChadEfaw/ChadEfaw.github.io/blob/main/Efaw_Geog550_Final.pdf">spatial-temporal analysis of fossil fuel production in West Virginia from 1970 to 2020.</a> This analysis allowed me to track the moving “center of gravity” of extraction and production – as well as the evolving modal production type: coal and then natural natural gas – over time throughout the state. 
            Are current regulations equipped to protect human health and wellbeing when the mode of resource extraction changes – in space, time, and type? 
            For a graduate-level economics course, I completed a spatial analysis <a href = "https://github.com/ChadEfaw/ChadEfaw.github.io/blob/main/Efaw_CleanEnergyInvestment_Paper.pd"></a></p>
      </div>
      
            <h3>Economics and Finance</h3>
            
            <p><a href = "https://github.com/ChadEfaw/ChadEfaw.github.io/blob/main/Efaw_CleanEnergyInvestment_Paper.pdf">This paper analyzes First Energy</a></a>
            This project analyzed <a href = "https://github.com/ChadEfaw/ChadEfaw.github.io/blob/main/Efaw_MunicipalFinance_Paper.pdf"></a>Fayetteville, West Virginia's municipal finances in comparison with other similarly-sized towns. I wrote code in R to scrape budgets from the West Virginia Secretary of State's office website</p>

            <h3>Ethics</h3>
            
            <p>I have written about <a href = "https://github.com/ChadEfaw/ChadEfaw.github.io/blob/main/Efaw_EnvEthics_Paper.pdf">environmental ethics</a>
            The most important professional experience of my life was being (unofficially) part of the <a href = "https://www.cyber.pitt.edu/algorithms#:~:text=The%20Pittsburgh%20Task%20Force%20on,and%20equity%20for%20all%20residents.">Pittsburgh Task Force on Public Algorithms </a>. This task force identified instances of where machine learning algorithms were used to make decisions in the public sector. Were these algorithms fair? Did they have biases? Who created them? I performed literature reviews and participated in public hearings.</p>
